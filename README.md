# Ghost
Ghost is a word game in which players take turns adding individual letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and, for our purposes, we will consider 4 to be the minimum word length. The player who completes a word or creates a fragment that is not the prefix of a word loses the round.
